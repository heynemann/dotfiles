# Fish Theme: coffeeandcode

Another theme choice for Oh-My-Fish! originally created by
[Jonathan Knapp](http://jonknapp.com).

### Warning:

This theme will overwrite all of your Fish color and git settings. If you'd like
to customize them, you will have to make changes to the `fish_prompt.fish` file
in this theme. All of the settings are listed at the top of the file.
